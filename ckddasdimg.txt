CKDDASD IMAGE FILE FORMAT SPECIFICATION

file extension: .ckdd

a CKDDASD Image file is broken up into two sections: the HEADER, and the DATA. the HEADER defines the structure of the DASD, and has three fields:
BINS: A 16 bit field expressing the number of bins (for compatibility with the 2321 data cells)
NUM_CYLINDERS: A 16 bit field expressing the number of cylinders per bin
NUM_TRACKS: A 16 bit field expressing the number of tracks per cylinder
TRACK_SIZE: A 16 bit field expressing the size of a track in bytes
Directly after the header is the data. The data is subdivided into BINS bins, which are each subdivided into NUM_CYLINDERS cylinders, whose size is NUM_TRACKS * TRACK_SIZE bytes. There are no boundary bits between bins, cylinders, or tracks
